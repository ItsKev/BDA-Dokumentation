Virtual reality has recently been gaining wide adoption, and an effective haptic feedback in these scenarios can strongly support user's sensory in bridging virtual and physical world. Since participants do not directly observe these robotic proxies, we investigate the multiple mappings between physical robots and virtual proxies that can utilize the resources needed to provide a well rounded VR experience. PhyShare bots can act either as directly touchable objects or invisible carriers of physical objects, depending on different scenarios. They also support distributed collaboration, allowing remotely located VR collaborators to share the same physical feedback.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in both Virtual Reality (VR) systems and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) technologies have resulted in the appearance of the Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) systems supporting different forms of collaboration and interaction between users. The collaboration in these systems refers to the simultaneous interaction (collaborative interaction) of multiple users on a virtual object in an immersive or semi-immersive Virtual Environment (VE). However, in some cases, the collaborative interaction is reduced to a simple communication between users. In this paper, we propose a new model of collaborative interaction that supports group interaction in CVEs. Our model defines the functional role and the functional clover of the 3D interaction. This Model is based on group awareness concepts (focus, nimbus and degree of interaction) combined with 3D interaction paradigms (navigation, selection and manipulation). The aim of our model is to manage and control the simultaneous user actions.},

Inside-out optical head tracking is coupled with a low-cost motion capture suit to track the full body and the head. Movements of users, 3D interactions and the positions of selected real world objects are distributed over a wireless network in a server-client architecture. As a result, users see the effect of their interactions with objects and other users in real time. We describe the architecture of our implemented proof-of-concept system.},

	abstract = {Immersive virtual environment can be used to bring both geographically distributed and co-located users to the same virtual place for collaboration. Compared to remote situations, co-located users collaborate in the same virtual world on top of a shared physical workspace. This collocation allows direct user communication and interaction without computer mediation which facilitates collaborative work. With the development of multi-user display and tracking technology, classical projection-based immersive setups (e.g. CAVE) can now support group immersion for co-located users by offering individual stereoscopic views without visual distortion. In this context, the coexistence of information from the virtual and real world, especially when users do not share a common spatial reference frame, provides users with a new kind of perceptual and cognitive experience. We are interested in how users perceive and communicate with each other to achieve a shared context for collaboration, and how we can broaden supported collaborative scenarios with more flexible viewpoint control.This PhD thesis mainly addresses perceptual and cohabitation issues that we identified in the aim of supporting safe and efficient co-located collaboration in immersive virtual environment. First, we conducted a case study to examine how perceptual conflicts would alter user communication and task performance. Second, we concentrated on the design and evaluation of appropriate navigation paradigms to allow individual virtual navigation while solving cohabitation problems in a shared limited physical workspace. At last, based on the results of previous studies, we designed a generic dynamic navigation model which integrates constrains from the physical workspace and also the virtual world to enable co-located collaboration in multi-user immersive systems.},

Beyond the architectural aspect, we give indications on the modularity and the genericity of our system, implemented in C++, which could be embedded into different VR platforms. Moreover, its XML-based configuration system allows it to be easily applicable to many different contexts. The reconfigurable features are then illustrated via two scenarios: a cognitive oriented assembly task with single user multimodal interactions, and an industrial assembly task with multimodal and collaborative interactions in a co-located multi-user environment.},

These are defined as where users can perceive each other (Level 1), individually change the scene (Level 2), or simultaneously act on and manipulate the same object (Level 3). Despite representing the highest level of cooperation, multiuser object manipulation has rarely been studied. This paper describes a behavioral experiment in which the piano movers' problem (maneuvering a large object through a restricted space) was used to investigate object manipulation by pairs of participants in a VE. Participants' interactions with the object were integrated together either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The former only allowed the common component of participants' actions to take place, but the latter used the mean. Symmetric action integration was superior for sections of the task when both participants had to perform similar actions, but if participants had to move in different ways (e.g., one maneuvering him/herself through a narrow opening while the other traveled down a wide corridor) then asymmetric integration was superior. With both forms of integration, the extent to which participants coordinated their actions was poor and this led to a substantial cooperation overhead (the reduction in performance caused by having to cooperate with another person).},

	abstract = {In this paper, we will present an overview of existing research in the vast area of IVH systems. We will also present our ongoing work on improving the expressive capabilities of IVHs. Because of the complexity of interaction, a high level of control is required over the face and body motions of the virtual humans. In order to achieve this, current approaches try to generate face and body motions from a high-level description. Although this indeed allows for a precise control over the movement of the virtual human, it is difficult to generate a natural-looking motion from such a high-level description. Another problem that arises when animating IVHs is that motions are not generated all the time. Therefore a flexible animation scheme is required that ensures a natural posture even when no animation is playing. We will present MIRAnim, our animation engine, which uses a combination of motion synthesis from motion capture and a statistical analysis of prerecorded motion clips. As opposed to existing approaches that create new motions with limited flexibility, our model adapts existing motions, by automatically adding dependent joint motions. This renders the animation more natural, but since our model does not impose any conditions on the input motion, it can be linked easily with existing gesture synthesis techniques for IVHs. Because we use a linear representation for joint orientations, blending and interpolation is done very efficiently, resulting in an animation engine especially suitable for real-time applications},

Existing computer-based tools to support virtual assembly either concentrate solely on representation of the geometry of parts and fixtures and evaluation of clearances and tolerances or use simulated human mannequins to approximate human interaction in the assembly process.

To address this challenge, we explore the concept of Substitutional Reality in the context of Virtual Reality: a class of Virtual Environments where every physical object surrounding a user is paired, with some degree of discrepancy, to a virtual counterpart. We present a model of potential substitutions and validate it in two user studies. In the first study we investigated factors that affect participants' suspension of disbelief and ease of use. We systematically altered the virtual representation of a physical object and recorded responses from 20 participants. The second study investigated users' levels of engagement as the physical proxy for a virtual object varied. From the results, we derive a set of guidelines for the design of future Substitutional Reality experiences.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the usage of tactile feedback to aid cooperative object manipulation using the SkeweR technique. This technique is based on the use of crushing points, where the users grab the object for the first time, to simultaneously move/rotate an object. Once the user keeps his hand positioned on the crushing point, during the object manipulation, the interaction becomes more natural, in the sense that it is more similar to the real process. However, due to the lack of any physical constraint to the users‚Äô movements, it is often noticed that the user‚Äôs hand moves apart from the crushing point during the interaction. To solve this problem, this work proposes the usage of tactile feedback to inform the user about the distance of his hand from the crushing point. The tactile feedback is provided by a vibration micromotor attached to the users‚Äô thumb. To validate our method, we ran a user study based on the 3D manipulation of a virtual object, which has to be translated and rotated through a virtual path along a virtual wire, from the beginning to the end of it. During the interaction, users manipulate a 3DOF position tracker and should keep this tracker at the same position of the crushing point. During the trials, the participants used three modalities of interaction: without any feedback, with a visual feedback and with tactile feedback. Results showed that the users kept the tracker closer to the crushing point when using tactile feedback.},

	abstract = {Assembly planning and evaluation is an important component of the product design process in which details about how parts of a new product will be put together are formalized. A well designed assembly process should take into account various factors such as optimum assembly time and sequence, tooling and fixture requirements, ergonomics, operator safety, and accessibility, among others. Existing computer-based tools to support virtual assembly either concentrate solely on representation of the geometry of parts and fixtures and evaluation of clearances and tolerances or use simulated human mannequins to approximate human interaction in the assembly process. Virtual reality technology has the potential to support integration of natural human motions into the computer aided assembly planning environment (Ritchie et al. in Proc I MECH E Part B J Eng 213(5):461‚Äì474, 1999). This would allow evaluations of an assembler‚Äôs ability to manipulate and assemble parts and result in reduced time and cost for product design. This paper provides a review of the research in virtual assembly and categorizes the different approaches. Finally, critical requirements and directions for future research are presented.},

	abstract = {Assembly constraint is an important factor for product assembly. Constraint is not only necessary for accurate locating of parts but also an important way to realize assembly operation process in virtual assembly (VA) system. In this study, to realize VA reasonably, uniform representations of assembly constraint, equivalent relation between constraint and degree of freedom (DOF), and movable DOF reduction are defined. Several algorithms including based-constraint assembly relation recognition, assembly parts location solving under free and constrained spaces, and movement navigation are developed. These algorithms have been applied to integration virtual assembly environment (IVAE) software system. An example is illustrated, and the results prove that the algorithms provide a good support for the constraint treatments in IVAE and the high consistence between virtual and real assembly process is realized.},

To ensure the good assembly of those objects, we propose a new method of interactive assembly that uses both kinematic constraints and guiding virtual fixtures. Modelling a haptic assembly task as a combination of mechanical joints, we focus on the guidance of objects and on the activation cues of kinematic constraints in physical simulation. In this article, we first outline the difficulties related to the haptic-assembly of CAD objects in VR simulation. Introducing the virtual constraint guidance (VCG), we present a new method for haptic guidance that decomposes a task in two independent steps: a guiding step which use geometries as virtual fixtures to position objects, and a functional step which use kinematic constraints to perform the assembly task. We finally present a complete application of our method on a peg-in-hole insertion task.},
